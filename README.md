## Snake Game

## Overview
This project involves implementing the classic Snake game as part of an exercise for the Introduction to Computer Science 67101 course. The goal is to apply programming concepts and practices to create a functioning game.
project involved creating the main game logic, implementing object interactions, and managing the graphical interface using Python. The game features dynamic gameplay, where players control a snake to collect apples, grow longer, and avoid obstacles. This exercise not only enhanced my programming skills but also provided hands-on experience with game development concepts and graphical display management.
## Features
- The game ends if the snake collides with itself, a wall, or a bomb.
- The snake grows longer when it eats an apple, increasing the player's score.
- Bombs appear randomly on the board and can end the game if the snake collides with one.
- The game uses a graphical interface for rendering the snake, apples, and bombs on the screen.

## How to Play
1. Run the game by executing the `snake_main.py` file.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
3. Avoid collisions with the snake's body, walls, and bombs.
4. Eat apples to grow the snake and increase your score.
5. The game ends when the snake collides with itself, a wall, or a bomb.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the game repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/jamilbar/Snake-Game).

## Running the Game
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where the game files are located.
- Run the game by executing the snake_main.py file
