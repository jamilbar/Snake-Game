## Snake Game

## Overview
This project involves implementing the classic Snake game as part of an exercise for the Introduction to Computer Science 67101 course. The goal is to apply programming concepts and practices to create a functioning game using the provided framework and instructions.

## Features
- The game ends if the snake collides with itself, a wall, or a bomb.
- The snake grows longer when it eats an apple, increasing the player's score.
- Bombs appear randomly on the board and can end the game if the snake collides with one.
- The game uses a graphical interface for rendering the snake, apples, and bombs on the screen.

## How to Play
1. Run the game by executing the `snake_main.py` file.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
3. Avoid collisions with the snake's body, walls, and bombs.
4. Eat apples to grow the snake and increase your score.
5. The game ends when the snake collides with itself, a wall, or a bomb.
